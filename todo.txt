-Game End Condition: When currentWordPool is empty, you might want to consider this a state where the game can either:

End immediately: If the player has no more words to draw and can't make progress.

Enter a "final hand" mode: Allow the player to finish placing any remaining cards in their hand without drawing new ones. Once their hand is empty and the pool is empty, the game ends.

You would implement a checkGameEndCondition() function that looks at currentWordPool.length and currentHand.length to determine if the game should end.
