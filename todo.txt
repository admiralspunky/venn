can I use 3 spelling rules, instead of one rule from each category? With a Setting to revert to the old way? Also, I would need a single, big wordlist. Fortunately, I can use a list from Wordliness as a base, just remove all the y-as-a-vowel words.

setting for number of starting hint cards?

setting to change number of circles (2-4)
option to change the number of hand cards (but remember that Dailies should always use the same number)
translate to other languages (wow, that's going to be an undertaking; not only does every single bit of on-screen text have to reference a separate file, but there will need to be an entire rules.js for every additional language)

even with the icons, I sometimes have trouble telling which tier 2 Zone is the overlap between two specific tier 1 Zones. Maybe, while you mouseover a tier 2 Zone, the relevant tier 1 Zones can change visually somehow? Maybe just make the titles bold, but only while the overlap Zone is being moused over.

words like 'beauty' would incorrectly trigger the 'contains exactly 3 vowels' rule because of the 'y'; perhaps we need an Exclusion list, but for now, just avoid using words like 'beauty' in any other rule
screen to show ALL the names of the rules, but dynamically, all of the rules that are currently in the file (well, I have a button that copies the list to the clipboard - it's not great, but it works for now)
